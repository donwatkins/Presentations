#### Slide 1 - Thank you for the introduction Dr. Gallagher and welcome to 'Reimagine Yourself' through free and open source resources available on the web. I’m a retired public educator, lifelong learner, free and open source advocate who enjoys sharing my passion for open educational resources. 

#### Slide 2 - I’m a dedicated Chrome user. Firefox is a great open source browser that supports many plugins that extend its usefulness. Safari runs on MacOS and iOS devices like the iPhone and iPad, Opera is a good browser and has built in support for VPN access. Microsoft Edge is a good choice too. Edge is based on Chromium which is the open source version of the Chrome browser.

#### Slide 3 - GCF Learn free has over 200 videos providing just in time lessons on computer basics, Internet basics, career planning, applying for jobs, work life, money management and training for every version of Microsoft Office since its inception.It’s an incredible community resource and it’s all free. 

#### Slide 4 - This is a site where you can find cheat sheets, templates that you can download getting started materials for using Office 365 for MacOS and Windows computers. 

#### Slide 5 - Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field of concern due to the rise of online banking, shopping and more. Your passwords should be secure but how do you ensure that they are and why is that important. Have you given any thought to your own passwords? Do you use the same passwords on multiple sites? 

#### Slide 6 - Most people use passwords that are based on personal information and are easy to remember. However, that also makes it easier for an attacker to crack them. Consider a four-digit PIN. Is yours a combination of the month, day, or year of your birthday? Does it contain your address or phone number? Think about how easy it is to find someone’s birthday or similar information. What about your email password—is it a word that can be found in the dictionary? If so, it may be susceptible to dictionary attacks, which attempt to guess passwords based on common words or phrases.

#### Slide 7 - One of the ways that you can ensure that your passwords are complex is to use a password manager that will help you generate good passwords and then store them securely. Bitwarden is an open source password manager that does just that. Best of all it comes as a desktop application, a web application and an app on iOS and Android devices. 

#### Slide 8 - On the left you see an example of Bitwarden’s tool to make secure password creation possible. On the right is an example of how to create a Bitwarden entry for a typical login password entry. Notice the fields for ‘username’ and ‘password.’ 

#### Slide 9 - Do you use text messages to communicate? How secure are they? Text messages are stored on phones indefinitely and if your phone is stolen or lost those messages can remain to become a security nightmare. One of the secure options is using WhatsApp that’s part of Facebook but there is some concern that Facebook could snoop on your messages. Therefore Signal is an open source and secure messaging option. You can download it from their website and install it on MacOS, Windows, Linux. In addition the apps are available on iOS and Android too. State-of-the-art end-to-end encryption (powered by the open source Signal Protocol) keeps your conversations secure. We can't read your messages or listen to your calls, and no one else can either. Privacy isn’t an optional mode — it’s just the way that Signal works. Every message, every call, every time.

#### Slide 10 - LibreOffice is a high quality alternative to Microsoft Office. I used its ancestor OpenOffice in my last masters degree program at St. Bonaventure University. I use it for everyday writing articles. I used it instead of Excel and sometimes I used it for presentations. You can download it and install it for MacOS, Windows and Linux. One of the beauties of LibreOffice is that you really own your documents. You don’t need an expensive program to access them. 

#### Slide 11 - You can access LibreOffice by visiting their website at http://LibreOffice.org or by using http://ninite.com. It’s easy to install and use and their documentation is superb. 


#### Slide 12 - Google Drive is a collection of tools that are provided by Google that come with a GMail address. Users have access to an really great online word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation tool. This presentation was created using Google Drive. You can download documents from the Google cloud in MS Office formats, PDF and open document formats. 

#### Slide 13 - I regularly use Google Drive for most of my writing for http://Opensource.com . Google Drive is a great collaboration tool. Your work is automatically saved. You can access Drive from any web browser and also using apps that are available on both iOS and Android. 


#### Slide 14 - Ninite is an wonderful resource that makes it easy to download and install dozens of free and open source applications. You have access to web browsers, messaging apps, media applications, imaging applications, developer tools like Python. The website is https://ninite.com 

#### Slide 15 - Maybe you’d like to write or at least explore writing and sharing your thoughts with others. My favorite is Wordpress which I’ve been using since 2005. I started blogging on Blogger which is owned by Google so if you have a Google account it’s easy to get started using Blogger. 

#### Slide 16 - Creating your own book is easy and largely free until you get ready to publish. I have published a couple of books with https://Lulu.com. I was technical support on “The Will to Survive” which was published on Lulu and is now available on Lulu and Amazon. Another option is Kindle Direct Publlishing. All the book templates are available for free on either website and there are lots of low cost publishing options available. 

#### Slide 17 - Graphics that you can freely and legally use are difficult to find sometimes but one of my favorite websites for free clipart is https://openclipart.org/ There are thousands of images available in a variety of formats. 

#### Slide 18 - Here are some examples of copyrighted images that are shared with Creative Commons. Notice the difference between CC by 2.0 and CC by-SA-2.0. 

#### Slide 19 - Here is an example of how the image is displayed and the Creative Commons attribution that should be shared with it. You can use the picture without the photographers permission provided that you use the attribution text. 

#### Slide 20 - Creative Commons offers licensing that makes sharing easier. Creative Commons is not an alternative to copyright. It works right alongside copyright. They work alongside copyright and enable you to modify your copyright terms to best suit your needs and the needs of your readers. 

#### Slide 21 - I don’t know if you’ve thought of sharing your thoughts with others and uploading them to your blog but that easily done using a smartphone. If you have your own laptop or desktop computer and you’re looking for a more powerful recording application then Audacity should be on your list. It supports up to 16 separate recording tracks and effects. You can save your work as open source ‘ogg’ files or as MP3 files. 

#### You can also share your work and ideas with Open Broadcaster Software(OBS) which allows you to save locally and/or stream to Facebook, YouTube or other video streaming sites. 

#### Slide 22 - Jitsi is my own favorite free video conferencing application. You can use it out nearly any browser and there is no time limit on meetings. It supports screen sharing, chat and face to face interactions. Google Meet is also free but it does require a Google account. Zoom requires and account and there is a free version that limits users to time and number of people connected. 

#### Slide 23 - Advertisements are annoying when reading articles on the internet. There is also growing concern with privacy. Google harvest what you search for and then serves your targetted advertising. You can avoid that by using a the DuckDuckGo search engine. You might like to keep using Google or some other search engine but still want to get rid of advertisements. I recommend "Ublock-Origin" which is an extension that’s easily added to Chrome and FireFox. Privacy Badger blocks websites from tracking you as you surf the web. DuckDuckGo is a privacy oriented search engine. It won't track what you're searching for like Google will. 

#### Slide 24 - Open educational resources are books, wikis, and other materials that are created by individuals and groups and are shared openly with others. They are copyrighted works but published with Creative Commons and other open licenses so that they can easily shared.

You can also remove a hard drive take it Staples and then donate the computer to community organizations which can refurbish the computers and provide them to others who cannot afford a new computer.
